## Motor types
All EVs seem to function on either IndAC, PMAC or BLCD motors. Brushed DC motors seem to not be desirable due to the high maintenance frequency associated with their use. In a brushed DC motor the brushes wear out over time, meaning that they have to be replaced regularly and their brush dust cleaned out of the motor. Brushless motors require relatively little maintenance, to the extent that motor maintenance isn't part of the expected inspection schedule in the Nissan Leaf's owner's servicing manual (only vehicle which was checked).

### DC Motors in EVs
DC motors in EVs such as the Nissan Leaf are brushless DC motors, which are apparently very similar to AC motors. They have similarly low maintenance requirements as AC motors since the maintenance on brushed DC motors stems from the friction-based deterioration of the brushes and the accumulated brush-dust. Brushed DC motors are also substantially louder than AC motors, which alone would probably disqualify them from most EV applications.

As far as I could tell no commercial EV uses normal DC motors. Brushless DC motors (BLDC) use permanent magnets in the rotor and an electronic controller (or several) to switch the current in the motor windings, which replaces the function of brushes. They are a newer development than standard AC motors but are also referred to sometimes as self-synchronous AC motors and they are nearly identical to permanent magnet AC motors
